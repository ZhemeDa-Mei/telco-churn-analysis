# telco-churn-analysis
Exploratory data analysis on Telco customer churn dataset
## Project Overview

This project explores customer churn patterns using the Telco Customer dataset.

Key focuses:
- Identify customer segments with higher churn risk
- Compare churned vs non-churned customers across contracts, tenure, and charges
- Practice end-to-end EDA workflow in Python (pandas)

This project is part of my data analyst learning journey.
